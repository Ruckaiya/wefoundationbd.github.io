                                A recent McKinsey study estimated as many as half of current jobs globally could be automated, and predicted 400 million jobs worldwide will be automated into nothing by 2030. Wall Street Journal predicts as high as 80% of the garment jobs will be replaced by the rise of robots powered by Artificial Intelligence. The impact will be devastating in Bangladesh further contributing to income inequality. Women in Bangladesh will be impacted disproportionately as women workers dominate the garment industry in Bangladesh. Computer literacy is now more crucial than ever.

                        <p class="col-xl-12">Bangladesh is at risk of suffering from the most devastating impacts of climate change than almost any other country in the world.  Environmental Justice Foundation report  says one in every seven people in Bangladesh will be displaced by climate change by 2050. Bangladesh is exceptionally vulnerable to climate change. Its low elevation, high population density and inadequate infrastructure all put the nation in harm’s way, along with an economy that is heavily reliant on farming. </p>
                        <p class="col-xl-12">WE Foundation believes climate literacy is extremely important for Bangladeshi people to cope with it and to contest for environmental justice on the world stage.

                        <h2>Cultural Literacy</h2>
                        <p>American educator professor E.D. Hirsch coined the term Cultural Literacy referring to the ability to understand and participate fluently in a given culture. The marginalized youth of Bangladesh often get further marginalized for not having the cultural literacy. For instance, members of marginalized groups can get excluded for not having cultural literacy like communicating in English or public speaking. unlike the affluent youth who often can afford to go to English medium schools. WE Foundation works towards to building cultural literacy for the marginalized youth and children to help them reaching their true potential.</p>
                        <h4 class="col-xl-12">Literacy Practices & Identity:</h4>
                        <p class="col-xl-12">We live in an age of hyper globalization where Bangladeshi youth has unprecedented access to global culture. If we do not learn about the richness of our own culture, we will not be able to appreciate the diversity of global cultures without losing ourselves. We believe, if we learn the richness of our own history and culture, we will be able to successfully navigate other cultures without trying to imitate them mindlessly. Our creativity and critical thinking ability are at their best when we are comfortable in our own skin that requires a deep and serious investigation in one’s own roots and heritage.  </p>
