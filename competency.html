                    <p>The core competencies of an organization are the specific things that it does best. It is important to
                            understand the core competencies of an organization in order to capitalize and leverage on those
                            aspects in its marketing plan in order to multiply its outreach potential. After a weeklong dialogue
                            and engagement with the WEF team, the Foundation’s core competencies have been identified to
                            be the following:</p>

                  <p>  The Foundation has access to world-
                    class educators who are pursuing research in various education related disciplines. The
                    
                    founder himself has been an impactful educator with a leadership role for over a decade
                    in leading English medium schools in Bangladesh like Scholastica and Aga Khan
                    School. He is currently pursuing his post graduate studies researching on multimodal
                    learning practices specializing on education for the marginalized population under the
                    supervision of Dr. Jennifer Rowsell, Canada research chair for multiliteracies.  </p>

                   <p> The Foundation has also successfully built a
                    global support system by which it is connected to social activists, volunteers, sponsors and
                    media & marketing support from around the world. For example: The Foundation has
                    already employed a North American Project Director, Macy Tuollefson at the Gazipur
                    Branch, who has extensive work experience in the field of development.

                            <p>Every organization has a competitive advantage that helps it survive against competition. A
                                    competitive advantage can either be Cost or Differentiation. If a company for example can produce
                                    its goods and services at a competitive cost, its competitive advantage is then Cost, which means
                                    the company will be able to charge a lower price than its competition. As a result consumers would
                                    be more likely to buy their products over their competitors’. Or if the company can produce goods
                                    and services that are unique and differentiated in a way that cannot be copied by others (for
                                    example through a patent), then it has a competitive advantage in differentiation, because
                                    consumers will only find such product through that company.</p>
        
                                    <p>WEF as a non-profit has a competitive advantage that revolves around differentiation. The aspect
                                            that differentiates it from the rest of the non-profits working in the education sector is its 3-leveled
                                            Literacy Model. This model incorporates a concept called Multimodal Learning Practices at the
                                            highest level of the pyramid. In a culture of memorization-based literacy, such a model not only
                                            stands-out but provides a more holistic and competent form of education. The primary objective of
                                            this model is to build thought leadership among students.</p>
        
                            <p>The Foundation has successfully managed to draw attention to North American Educational and
                                    development work researchers. It currently recruits interns from North American unvierisities
                                    providing world class work.</p>
        
                            <p>The Foundation gives emphasis on wholistic education. It accommodates and nurters diverse
                                    talents of stuents through sports and art based performances like music, arti, performing art, play,
                                    folk music and so on.</p>
