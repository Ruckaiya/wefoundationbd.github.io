       <li>
        <span class="number">2</span>
        <span class="goal" style="color: #9d2235">ENGLISH LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY</span>
        <p>WEF wants to build empathetic global citizen in an increasingly globalized world. We
            want to equip our children with English language proficiency due to its indispensability,
            equally promoting and appreciating our mother tongue to protect and foster our cultural
            diversity.</p>

        <span class="goal" style="color: #9d2235">COMPUTER LITERACY</span>
        <p>WEF also wants to make sure that their students have a basic level of how to use a
            computer in everyday life and beyond. In this day and age where access to information
            is foundational to a successful life and career, WEF understands the need to provide
            basic computer literacy to all its students.</p>

        <span class="goal" style="color: #9d2235">THOUGHT LEADERSHIP</span>
        <p>The ultimate short-term goal is to build thought leadership in each of our students to
            enable them to solve problems in a dynamic world that gives rise to newer
            circumstances every day. WEF hopes to help students take agency of their own lives:
            through active engagement and intellectual immersion. Thought leadership is helping
            students to help themselves so that they do not need any help further.</p>

               <span class="goal" style="color: #9d2235">LITERACY FOR ALL</span>
               <p>By 2030 WEF aims to provide literacy to 40,000 marginalized people in the country. It is
                    currently running four branches (two in Gazipur, one in Dhaka, and one in Pabna) and
                    eventually hopes to scale out to the rest of the county.</p>

            <p>Through the WEF three-leveled literacy model, the Foundation hopes to create social
                    capital among all marginalized communities. While at an individual level thought
                    leadership is what breeds agency in one’s life, at a community level it is the building of
                    social capital that breeds an economically empowered community. This will be achieved
                    by facilitating entrepreneurial ventures, job creation and community based solutions.</p>

                    genders, facilitating open dialogue and discussion and providing a platform for
                    marginalized women’s advancement.</p>

            <p>WEF is conscious of the impact we create on the environment everyday. The
                    Foundation aims to ensure environmental sustainability by inculcating conscientious
                    decision-making skill among students in their everyday activities.</p>
