        <h1>Brand Analysis</h1>
      <!-- <p><a href="http://octaviabutler.org">Octavia Estelle Butler</a> (June 22, 1947 – February 24, 2006) was an American science fiction writer. A multiple recipient of both the Hugo and Nebula awards, Butler was one of the best-known women in the field. In 1995, she became the first science fiction writer to receive the MacArthur Fellowship, nicknamed the "Genius Grant".</p>

        <h2>Brand Character</h2>
      <p>  WE Foundation is an active and enthusiastic participator in the Bangladeshi society. The
Foundation has a strong passion to better the lives of the marginalized population and it is
compassionate and empathetic in its approach and activities. It has not only been a local brand
but has a significant reach within the international community. The Foundation focuses as
much on the development of the community as it does on the individual, with an objective to
remain a participatory organization rather than a hierarchical one. It is unique in the way that it
tries to teach literacy of the ‘world’ rather than literacy of the ‘word’ (a founding philosophy),
giving its students a foundational understanding of how the world works in order to navigate it
and build a meaningful happy life. We promote a philosophy of loving and living life, and not
just surviving it. The operating ethos of WE Foundation is to nurture the endowed potential in
every student to grow to its entirety. </p>

      <p>The Foundation currently consists of four branches: two operating in Gazipur, one in Pabna
        and one in Dhaka, with the following structure.</p>

        <p style="font-weight:600; font-size: 150%;">THE CENTRAL SYSTEM </p>
         <p>The main purpose of the central system will be to ensure the smooth running of the
Foundation. It will address all key issues that concern the Foundation, deal with and resolve
issues arising from specific branch literacy centers, and design and implement strategies for
communication with all external parties. The Central System will be operated by five main
personnel: The President, Vice-President, Central Communication’s Officer, Secretary and Treasurer, the first three of which may have an Office of their own under which sub-teams will
operate.

      <h2>Audience</h2>
      <p>Publishers and critics have tended to label Butler's work as science fiction, but while Butler enjoyed working in what she called "potentially the freest genre in existence", she resisted being branded a genre writer. As many critics have pointed out, her narratives have drawn attention of people from varied ethnic and cultural backgrounds, and she herself claimed to have three loyal audiences: black readers, science-fiction fans, and feminists.</p>

      <h2>Interviews</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66pu-Miq4tk">Charlie Rose interviewed Octavia Butler</a> in 2000 soon after the award of a MacArthur Fellowship. The highlights are probing questions that arise out of Butler's personal life narrative and her interest in becoming not only a writer, but a writer of science fiction. Rose asked, "What then is central to what you want to say about race?" Butler's response was, "Do I want to say something central about race? Aside from, 'Hey we're here!'?" This points to an essential claim for Butler that the world of science fiction is a world of possibilities, and although race is an innate element, it is embedded in the narrative, not forced upon it.</p>
      
      <p>In an interview by Randall Kenan, Octavia E. Butler discusses how her life experiences as a child shaped most of her thinking. As a writer, Butler was able to use her writing as a vehicle to critique history under the lenses of feminism. In the interview, she discusses the research that had to be done in order to write her bestselling novel, Kindred. Most of it is based on visiting libraries as well as historic landmarks with respect to what she is investigating. Butler admits that she writes science fiction because she does not want her work to be labeled or used as a marketing tool. She wants the readers to be genuinely interested in her work and the story she provides, but at the same time she fears that people will not read her work because of the "science fiction" label that they have.</p>
